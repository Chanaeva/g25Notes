#CLI
package = program
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager

command line is used to quickly easily use programs that can be combined and what not…

brew is a package manager

##Paths
absolute path is the path to a file from anywhere, a forward slash ( / ) specifies root meaning it’s an absolute path
relative path is the path to a file from where you are in a directory

##Random
.  = current directory
.. = up directory
grep “ “ =  finder
cp = copy
history = tells all history
-r = recursive
touch = creates files by updating time stamp, updates time stamp
more = page through
less = because less is more, file reader

##Piping
introduced in unix
takes the output of one package to be the input of another package ( | )
">  output"
">>  append"
""<  input"

Unix philosophy: do one thing and do it well. then combinations create sophisticated programs.

chains = combining of tasks with && and ;
&& =  after first success “then and”
; = “and” doesn’t require first success

##Permissions
Permissions reference treehouse. first of 7 permissions is the directory, file type.
chmod = octal representation, change permissions, also takes in “u+x” stuff
chown = change ownership
sudo = makes root user, has all power
sudo su = makes root user for session

command line murder mystery for more practice

#Git Hub

git init- initialize repository into the an empty directory

git add- takes untracked files added in the repository and starts the process of them being tacked.

git commit- makes a save of the files (at this point in time you have a local repository)

git status- tells me repository files status
 git log- shows all previous commits

git push [origin] [master]
git remote -v = tells you all your places your pushing to
git remote add origin = tell the url of github or wherever
(pushing is the process of taking a local repository and putting it on github)

#HTML
is a tree structure, a tree structure starts with one root and is the parent child structure/relationship that can continue with no end.
character whatsamahozits for special html characters so that they can be read as not html.
less than symbol:
&ls;

& starts

between tags is called content

##element vs tag
tag is a tag
element is an object that comes from the browser reading the html.

user style is the default style given to elements by the browser

##Random
(cmd + opt + i) brings up dev tools
(cmd + opt +u)

html 5 document type is <!doctype html> no caps needed

title tag sets the title for the browser and is what is displayed in searches and bookmarks

head is meta data not shown on actual webpage to user
body is everything that you have control over

meta char set is not needed for up to date html 5 but required for older versions of html

attributes are things on tags in the form of
<p attribute=“value”>

self-closing = closing itself, meaning it can’t have children

( man.io ) shortcut for mozilla for what you have going on.

##Semantic HTML
separation of discernment of concerns
SEO
Accessibility
Readability
Consumability

(cmd + opt + f) = make full screen
indenting = shift tab and command with brackets
