# g25Notes
Hi guys I created this repository to give us a place to put all our notes together, yay! Like this README.md, the notes 
are in .md as well so that it's easier to read, if you want to know more about .md syntax I found this:
http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax
This is for all of us so I would be stoked if we all contributed, I should note that I think it's important to not 
delete each other's notes (we all take them differently and learn from them differently and I want to respect that. 
I hope this is useful to anyone that needs it. Also I was thinking we could have different files for each week with the
format of week1Notes.md and just change the week number, please let me know what you think of this, so we can change it
if needed. WOHOO!
