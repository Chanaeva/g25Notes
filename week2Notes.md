#Programming
at it's basic level takes an input transforms it and gives you an output. Programs are made up of programs.

input to binary to logic-gates to processor to circuit   

##Communication
Sudo code is for people to understand when talking about code. Used to discuss concepts that
translate to different languages.

A programming language is something that can do these 4 things:
Sequence = control what order things happen in (order)
Selection = being able to pick parts of code to execute (conditions)
Iteration = repeating (loops)
Recursion

Structured English
using English to express computer stuff, using syntax of structured programming. A reduced language set then sudo code.
